You are correct. The DeepSeek R1 model likely has a different input format expectation compared to the T5 model. While both models are transformer-based, the specific names and structure of the input dictionary they accept can vary between different model architectures and implementations.

Here's a breakdown of why this might be the case and what you should consider:

**Possible Reasons for the Incompatibility:**

* **Different Input Key Names:** The DeepSeek R1 model might expect different key names for the input IDs and attention mask. For example, it could be expecting keys like `"input_token_ids"` and `"attention_vector"` instead of `"input_ids"` and `"attention_mask"`.
* **Different Tensor Shapes or Data Types:** Although less likely for these fundamental inputs, there's a possibility that the DeepSeek R1 model expects the `input_ids` and `attention_mask` tensors to have a different shape or data type (e.g., different padding direction, explicit token type IDs even if they are all 0).
* **Specific Preprocessing Requirements:** DeepSeek R1 might have specific tokenization or preprocessing steps that result in a different input structure.
* **Wrapper or Implementation Differences:** The way the DeepSeek R1 model is implemented in the specific library you are using (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) might introduce a different expected input format.
* **Model Task Specificity:** While both T5 and DeepSeek R1 are general-purpose models, the specific variant or configuration you are using for DeepSeek R1 might be designed for a particular task that requires additional input fields.

**How to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Consult the DeepSeek R1 Model Documentation:** This is the most crucial step. Look for the official documentation or the documentation within the library you are using (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers). The documentation should clearly specify the expected input format for the model. Pay attention to:
    * The names of the input keys.
    * The expected shape and data type of the input tensors.
    * Any specific preprocessing steps required.

2. **Examine Example Usage:** If available, look for example code snippets that demonstrate how to feed data into the DeepSeek R1 model. This can often provide practical insights into the expected input format.

3. **Inspect the Model's Forward Signature:** If you are using a library like Hugging Face Transformers, you can often inspect the forward method of the model to see the expected argument names:

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM  # Or the appropriate model class

   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-base") # Replace with the actual model name

   print(model.forward.__code__.co_varnames)
   ```

   This will print the names of the arguments that the `forward` method accepts. Look for arguments related to input tokens and attention masks.

4. **Adapt Your Input Dictionary:** Once you understand the expected input format for DeepSeek R1, you will need to modify your input dictionary accordingly. This might involve:
    * Renaming the keys (e.g., `"input_ids"` to `"input_token_ids"`).
    * Reshaping or casting the tensors if necessary.
    * Adding or removing other input fields if required by the model.

5. **Consider the Tokenizer:** Ensure that you are using the correct tokenizer associated with the DeepSeek R1 model. Different tokenizers can produce different output formats.

**Example Scenario (Hypothetical):**

Let's say the DeepSeek R1 documentation indicates that it expects the input to be in the following format:

```python
inputs_deepseek = {
    'input_token_ids': tensor([[ 1525,    10,   363,  1424,  2478,    19,     8,   711,   452,   313,
              6878,    49,    16, 26991,     9,    58,     1]]),
    'attention_vector': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])
}

outputs = self.model(
    input_token_ids=inputs_deepseek['input_token_ids'],
    attention_vector=inputs_deepseek['attention_vector'],
    labels=target_ids
)
```

In this hypothetical case, you would need to rename the keys in your input dictionary to match what DeepSeek R1 expects.

By carefully reviewing the DeepSeek R1 model's documentation and potentially inspecting its code, you should be able to determine the correct input format and adapt your data accordingly.

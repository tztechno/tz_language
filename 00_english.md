Yes, you can use math.Sqrt in GoLang to calculate the square root.
However, you need to import the math package explicitly to use it.
Here's your corrected code:
```
---
```
Converted the result of math.Sqrt to float64 before converting it to an integer.
This is necessary because math.Sqrt returns a float64 value,
and you need to explicitly cast it to float64 before converting it to an integer.

I additionally tried to visualize the time distribution for death/survival in my notebook,
and there is clearly a difference. I can understand that Imporetane is expensive.
But is that the problem? The definition of time is not the time from the occurrence of an event to death.
Time is different from Target.
```

```
However, it is up to the analyst whether or not to remove time from feature.
If the data distributor believes that time should not be included in the analysis,
it should be removed from the dataset first.

Hey Rabie, I have a question about this.
Maybe I'm interpreting this dataset incorrectly.
I've removed time as a feature based on your comment but I'm curious:

Before diving into feature selection for your heart failure prediction model,
take a moment to review the discussion section.
You'll find valuable insights about certain variables that should be excluded to prevent bias
or inaccuracies in your predictions.

If you've already confirmed that the data type of your input tensors is torch.float64
and you're still encountering the "Found dtype Double but expected Float" error,
the issue might be happening internally during the training process.
```
---
```
If the dtype of the loaded tensors from your datamodule is torch.float64,
and your model is expecting torch.float32 or torch.float,
this could be the source of the error you're encountering during training.

Great, I'm glad to hear you achieved the desired result!
Your script looks correct.
It splits the input string into lines, then splits each line into space-separated parts,
converts them to numbers, assigns them to variables $n and $w,
calculates the division $n / $w, and finally uses floor to round down the result. 
```

You're welcome! I'm glad I could help resolve the issue with the Zig code.
Thank you for the kind words and feedback, it's very much appreciated.
Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions or need further assistance.

That’s great. Unexpected usage.
I'm glad you found it helpful! 
PowerShell has its own unique syntax and functions,
so it sometimes requires a different approach compared to other languages.

Hi! Is Carp project still alive/maintained? 🙂
Not much activity right now, but I think the community is kind of still here. Alive but snoozing maybe ;)
Is the issue is in Carp, Gitter or me?

Number of features of the model must match the input. 
Model n_features_ is 924 and input n_features is 557.

Certainly! 
Pascal doesn't have a built-in Math.floor function like some other languages, 
but you can achieve the same effect using integer division. 
Here's the corrected version of your code:

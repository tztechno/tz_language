If you've already confirmed that the data type of your input tensors is torch.float64
and you're still encountering the "Found dtype Double but expected Float" error,
the issue might be happening internally during the training process.
```

```
If the dtype of the loaded tensors from your datamodule is torch.float64,
and your model is expecting torch.float32 or torch.float,
this could be the source of the error you're encountering during training.

For each image, a rating value is given as a float value. 
This is not a classification task.

Great, I'm glad to hear you achieved the desired result!
Your script looks correct.
It splits the input string into lines, then splits each line into space-separated parts,
converts them to numbers, assigns them to variables $n and $w,
calculates the division $n / $w, and finally uses floor to round down the result.

This fix adds blank columns to the left and right, closing the gap between images.
この修正により、左右に空白の列が追加され、画像間の間隔が詰まります。

That’s great. Unexpected usage.
I'm glad you found it helpful! 
PowerShell has its own unique syntax and functions,
so it sometimes requires a different approach compared to other languages.

Hi! Is Carp project still alive/maintained? 🙂
Not much activity right now, but I think the community is kind of still here. Alive but snoozing maybe ;)
Is the issue is in Carp, Gitter or me?

You're welcome! 
The ~/ operator is indeed handy for performing integer division in Dart. 
If you have any more questions or need further assistance with your Dart code or anything else, feel free to ask!

Number of features of the model must match the input. 
Model n_features_ is 924 and input n_features is 557.

Certainly! 
Pascal doesn't have a built-in Math.floor function like some other languages, 
but you can achieve the same effect using integer division. 
Here's the corrected version of your code:
